## JavaScript vs. Python

|                | JavaScript | Python |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Strings        | ☑          | ☑      |
| Booleans       | ☑          | ☑      |
| Arrays (Lists) | ☑          | ☑      |
| Functions      | ☑          | ☑      |
| Classes        | ☑          | ☑      |
| Loops          | ☑          | ☑      |
| if-else        | ☑          | ☑      |

## So what _is_ the difference?

---

### JavaScript runs in the browser
- JavaScript is the language of the browser
- Python is not going to manipulate the DOM, or replace React.
- You can write your server in Python, but not the front-end code.

---

### Python is great multi-purpose tool

- Python does backend really well (we'll see this firsthand next week!)
- Python has diverse popular libraries that extend the functionality.
    - widely used by for applications in sciences, machine learning

---

### Syntax

We'll be using the same concepts we already know, just with a new look!
- whitespace aware vs. curly braces for code blocks
- no more semi-colons to end lines
- `True` and `False` instead of `true` and `false`
- and MUCH more

### Python style guide
- People may have opinions on how to format your JavaScript code...
- But Python (the language!) has opinions about how to format your Python code.
    - [PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Python has opinions on more than just styling...

### It also has guiding principles on designing Pythonic code!

[The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

You can read this with the Python interpreter!

```python=
import this
```

    - Video: Reading Python
    - Video: Python REPL

---

## Installation walkthrough
- Install Pyenv
- Configure shell environment for Pyenv by updating startup scripts
    - Windows users need to install some extra dependencies for Python
- Install Python (using Pyenv)
- Install Pipenv
    - Don't worry about this - we'll get to it next week!

---

## Verifying your Python install

1. The following commands should return the same Python 3.9.4+ version:
```
python --version
python3 --version
```
2. `which python` should return `~/.pyenv/shims/python`
